## About Dataset (From Kaggle)

The data is used for building the 3D printer anomaly detection system. Please refer to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Justin900429/3d-printer-anomaly-detect).

This dataset includes two different kinds of data:

1. Defected
2. Non-defected

We have provide a training example notebook and also how to do the Quantization to reduce the model size.
